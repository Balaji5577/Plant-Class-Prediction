# Plant-Class-Prediction

## About Dataset

This project involves building a machine learning model to predict the class of a plant based on various features. The dataset includes multiple plant species and their characteristics, which are used to train the model.

## Dataset Description

Random: An identifier for each record, likely indicating a random sample or batch.

Average of chlorophyll in the plant (ACHP): The average chlorophyll content in the plant.

Plant height rate (PHR): The rate of plant height growth.

Average wet weight of the growth vegetative (AWWGV): The average wet weight of vegetative growth.

Average leaf area of the plant (ALAP): The average leaf area of the plant.

Average number of plant leaves (ANPL): The average number of leaves per plant.

Average root diameter (ARD): The average diameter of the plant & roots.

Average dry weight of the root (ADWR): The average dry weight of the plant & roots.

Percentage of dry matter for vegetative growth (PDMVG): The percentage of dry matter in vegetative growth.

Average root length (ARL): The average length of the plant & roots.

Average wet weight of the root (AWWR): The average wet weight of the plant & roots.

Average dry weight of vegetative plants (ADWV): The average dry weight of vegetative parts of the plant.

Percentage of dry matter for root growth (PDMRG): The percentage of dry matter in root growth.

Class: The class or category to which the plant record belongs.


## Objective

This project aims to create a predictive model that can accurately classify plants into their respective Classes based on input features.
